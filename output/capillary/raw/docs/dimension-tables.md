# Dimension tables

Dimension tables contain descriptive attributes or characteristics of the data in the fact table. These attributes provide context for analysing the data in the fact table. In the current example, For example, a dimension table in a sales environment might contain details about products (product ID, product name, category, brand) or customers (customer ID, name, address).

At Capillary backend, points categories are classified into four types, with three expected to be visible on the front-end exports. Following table gives the category types:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Value
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        regular_points
      </td>

      <td>
        Redeemable points.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        trackers
      </td>

      <td>
        These will not appear in exports. Trackers are excluded from the point fact.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        promised_points
      </td>

      <td>
        Strategy-based based points that accrue with a delay based on a specified return window. Their conversion date is known and available in the "awarded_date" field.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        external_trigger_based_points
      </td>

      <td>
        Promised points that convert to regular points upon the receipt of an external trigger. An external trigger can be a transactional event or a [behavioural event](https://docs.capillarytech.com/docs/setup-test-behavioral-events).

        Refer to the documentation on [Convert Promised Points API](https://docs.capillarytech.com/reference/points-unlock-api) for more information on converting points.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

When handling promised points, the categorization must be done based on points categories only (and not based on non-redeemable values during query writing).
